## How does the Fuzzy Fuurzle NFT marketplace function?
A user can mint a Fuzzy Fuurzl NFT. Using a form, they enter a name, description, image, and predetermined traits. The application combines these pieces to mint the NFT into a blockchain. It then stores its metadata and asset to IPFS. Users can also list their NFTs for sale, purchase from each other, view the NFTs they own through a profile page, and mint an NFT simply by providing a valid JSON metadata link and setting a price.
